      <section><em><strong> If your country is not listed above, don't worry-- we still offer free delivery within 3 days via FedEx international priority.</strong> However, due to the complexity of the import process, we are unable to accurately estimate and charge you for customs fees and import taxes during the checkout process. You are responsible for paying these, and Fedex customer support will contact you when the package arrives in your country to arrange payment (it is very straightforward-- they just call you). If a package is refused and we are charged shipping and/or duties, that amount will be deducted from original order before a refund is credited.</em></section>
