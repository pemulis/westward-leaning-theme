          <h2>FOR ALL VISIONARIES</h2>
          <p>Westward Leaning launched in San Francisco in 2012 with a simple idea: to make products that are equally beautiful and meaningful. Our premise is that social causes and progressive issues shouldn’t just be an afterthought, or a marketing pitch. Instead they should be an integral part of everything from the product's design to how we use its proceeds.</p>
