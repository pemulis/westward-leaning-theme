# Westward Leaning Production Theme

I worked at [Westward Leaning](http://westwardleaning.com/) from October 2013 through November 2015, coding Shopify themes and internal products. This was the final Shopify theme I built for them, with coding support by the outstanding [Janet Douglass](https://github.com/Janetyyy) and awesome designs by [Eliot Jungers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eliotjungers) and [Jacqueline Wallace](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacqueline-wallace-3ab93176).

## A Beautiful, Responsive Shopify Theme
